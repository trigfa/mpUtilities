mpUtilities
===========

These are various python modules which  are used by a couple of python programs I use for Linac QA.

They include:
- mc2 which is used for parsing data from our PTW ploting tank,
- webline which is used for parsing the datafiles from the PTW webline daily check devices, 
- graphUtils which contains a number of utilities for when drawing graphs
- peakdetect is a library of peak detection routines (Note: These were forked from https://gist.github.com/sixtenbe/1178136)
